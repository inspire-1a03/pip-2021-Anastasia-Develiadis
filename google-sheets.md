# Exploring COVID-19 patterns with Google Sheets

## 1. Trends in national case data
> Q1: How has daily COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths changed in Canada over time since the beginning of the pandemic?

#### Summary

**Change in the number of cases:** Throughout the three waves, the change in the number of cases increases significantly. 

**Change in the number of fatalities:** Throught the first two waves, the number of fatalities remains at a high rate, however, the third wave shows the fatalities decrease significantly as vaccine distribution increases. 

**Total Hospitalization:** The first wave shows that the hospitalization is very low however, increases through the second and third wave. 

**Overall:** Although the change in the number of cases increases thoughout the three waves of the pandemic, the increase in hospitalizations in the second and third wave may account for the decreases in the number of fatalities in the third wave.

#### Summary
There is a steady increase of tests per 100 people beginning in April of 2020 followed by a steady increase of vaccinations not beginning until January of 2021.

#### Summary
Nova Scotia, Nunavut and Northwest Territories have a significatly higher number and rate of vaccinations per 100 people than the rest of the provinces. The other provinces appear to follow the same trend at a significantly lower rate and number.

#### Summary
It appears that during the first wave of the pandemic, beginning in April of 2020, there was a significant increase in visits to parks while other mobility trends remain somewhat steady.

## Final reflection

As we can see, the number of cases increases with every wave, however the fatalities from the second to third wave decreases. The time period from the peak of the second wave to the peak of the third wave (in terms of cases), occurred from around January of 2021 to May 2021 where we see a significant increase in cases but a decrease in deaths. If we look to the second figure, we see May 2021 having the highest number of vaccinations per 100 people, so we can make the inference that the decrease in the number of deaths could be due to an increase of vaccinations.
 
Additionally, per the second figure, vaccinations started being administered in Canada around January of 2021 and this is when we see the second wave reach its peak in number of cases and start decreasing. 

In the third figure, we see that the three outliers in the trend of vaccination rates are Nova Scotia, Nunavut, and Northwest Territories which have a significantly higher rate than the other provinces. However, the reasons for this are unknown and this is a question I would ask moving further into the research of this topic. 

In the fourth figure, we see mobility trends in Canada over the course of the pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, around April of 2020, we see a sharp increase in visits to parks. While this could be a result of all other public places being closed down, it could also be a result of people going outside due to an increase in temperature as Canada enters into its summer months. 

Moving forward, it would be helpful to know what kind of access that the three provinces/ territories had to vaccinations that the other provinces did not to figure of why they had so much of higher vaccination rate. It will also be useful to see the upcoming trends in the populations mobility to parks this summer to see if it matches the trend of last summer with more public places likely opening up.
